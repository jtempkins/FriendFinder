# FriendFinder
## The app won't run. After myriad issues with the code it continues to have issues. The latest one is Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<'. It is convinced that the open script tag does not have a close tag. It does.
## It is impossible to know if the rest of the program is running. I hope it will!

## Overall, the concept is a new Friendless dater comes to the site, fills in their name, adds a link to a photo and answers 10 questions. 
## The scores of the 10 questions are compared to the friends.js "database". The closest match is considered the bestMatch. A model pops up and informs the Friendless dater who the best match is.
